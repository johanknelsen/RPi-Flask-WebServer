#Raspberry Pi Water Drop Controller

The idea is to be able to use the raspberry pi as a web interface for quickly dialing in your settings in order to trigger two drop from an electronic solenoid and then trigger the camera as the drops hit the surface of water in the dish below.  This has been implimented in this forked project from [Marcelo Rovai](https://github.com/Mjrovai/RPi-Flask-WebServer.git).
